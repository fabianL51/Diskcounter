Hello, fellow developers

I just want to say, I'm aware that my coding style in this program isn't the clean or neat at all, I even needed to write down the workflow in my handbook to understand what
really happens down there, but my codes do currently exactly what I want them to do, so I'm more than satisfied with it.

Good luck in understanding my workflow and happy coding!
