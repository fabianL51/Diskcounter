# Diskcounter
Diskcounter is a simple financial manager that I created to fill my needs of a clean financial 
documentation. The idea is to use Microsoft Excel to store the transactions data and utilize 
VBA to calculate the simple but repetitive calculations.
The program is currently in version 8.2, which is and will be the latest version I developed 
as it already has all features that I need for personal use. Enjoy!
