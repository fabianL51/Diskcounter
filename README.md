# Diskcounter

Diskcounter is a simple bookkeeping software for Microsoft Excel. The goal is to give users an insight about incomes and expenses over the year and to process recurring expenses automatically. The idea is to use the features of Microsoft Excel to have a clean documentation of all daily transactions and to use VBA to automate the entire process. 

The software is currently in version 8.2, which is and will be the latest version I developed as I am not comfortable with the slow processing speeds of VBA when it comes to handling several hundred rows of Excel data. You can read about the features that the program offers in README. Enjoy!

To see the bookkeeping software I am currently developing in C++ for Linux, see Vinager (https://github.com/fabianL51/Vinager).
