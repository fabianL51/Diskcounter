# Diskcounter

Diskcounter is a simple bookkeeping software for Microsoft Excel. The idea is to use the features of Microsoft Excel to have a clean documentation of all daily transactions. For this purpose, I use VBA to automate the bookkeeping process in Microsoft Excel. Users will get an insight about incomes and expenses over the year. Recurring expenses will be processed automatically to relieve users from repetitive input of the transaction details. The software is currently in version 8.2, which is and will be the latest version I developed as I am not comfortable with the slow processing speeds of VBA when it comes to handling several hundred rows of Excel data. You can read about the features that the program offers in README. Enjoy!

To see the bookkeeping software I am currently developing in C++ for Linux, see Vinager (https://github.com/fabianL51/Vinager).
